### Hi there Zaky's here

I work as a Learner at Apple Developer Academy @ BINUS and a Machine Learning Advisor at Bangkit Academy.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new.

### What I'm focusing on

Currently I like to develop apps using Swift and Kotlin aswell as applying machine learning in my project.
